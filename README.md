In partial fulfillment of COSC 203 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

## Goal
1. Create a data structures toolkit that showcases the following algorithms:
    - Arrays
    - Linked Lists
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Binary Search Tree
2. The toolkit must feature a menu where the user will be able to choose among the 6 data structures mentioned above.
3. Each data structure in the menu must lead to another menu where the user will be able to execute the following operations on the data structures:
    1. Arrays
        - Create an empty array
        - Insert element
        - Delete element
        - Arrange in ascending and descending order
        - Return to main menu
    2. Linked Lists
        - Create an empty linked list
        - Insert element
        - Delete element
        - Reverse the list
        - Remove duplicates from the list
        - Return to main menu
    3. Stacks
        - Create an empty stack
        - Push element
        - Pop element
        - Edit an element
        - Return to main menu
    4. Queues
        - Create an empty queue
        - Enqueue element
        - Dequeue element
        - Check front element
        - Check back element
        - Return to main menu
    5. Binary Search Tree
        - Create an empty binary tree
        - Insert element
        - Delete element
        - Return to main menu

## Tech Stack
This project is made only with base HTML, CCS, and JavaScript. The UI is enhanced with [DoodleCSS](https://github.com/chr15m/DoodleCSS).

This project utilized JavaScript ES6 and HTML5 Canvas. To run this project, run `index.html`.
